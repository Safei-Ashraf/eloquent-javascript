A large program is a costly program, increaseing size of the program means it has increased complexity of both time to build and size of the program itself.

Thic could lead to further issues related to maintaining the program and performance.



### Abstraction

hide details and gives us the ability to talk about programs in a higher level context (more abstract)

it makes content shorter and easier to interpret, it is a useful skill in programming to be able to notice when you are working at a very low level of abstraction.
