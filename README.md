This is my personal summary of the book and solution to the problems after each chapter.

" Full solutions to the exercises are not included in this book, but you can find them online at https://eloquentjavascript.net/code. If you want to learn something from the exercises, I recommend looking at the solutions only after you’ve solved the exercise, or at least after you’ve attacked it long and hard enough to have a slight headache."

Feel free to look up my solutions or improve them your own way, the summary of each chapter might not cover fully the whole book, duh it's a summary, but it should be a good referesher when needed.
