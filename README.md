This is my personal summary of the book and solution to the problems after each chapter.

Feel free to look up my solutions or improve them your own way, the summary of each chapter might not cover fully the whole book, duh it's a summary, but it should be a good referesher when needed.

Each .md file will contain the chapter summary information and .js file will contain the solution to exercises on that particular chapter.

All solutions are available online via book publishiers. For more information, [Check the official website of the book here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

" Full solutions to the exercises are not included in this book, but you can find them online at https://eloquentjavascript.net/code. If you want to learn something from the exercises, I recommend looking at the solutions only after you’ve solved the exercise, or at least after you’ve attacked it long and hard enough to have a slight headache."
